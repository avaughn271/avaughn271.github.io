The Nielsen Lab website was designed by <a href="/team/andrew-vaughn">Andrew Vaughn</a> based on the excellent template provided by Trevor Bedford for [his lab website](http://bedford.io). See [this page](https://bedford.io/misc/about/) for information about using Trevor's template. Inspiration (and code) was also taken from other sites that use Trevor's template, including the  [Riggleman Lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu/), the [Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/), and the [Canepa Lab](https://caneparesearch.org/).

If you find any errors in this website (broken links, images not displaying, typos, etc.), feel free to report them to <a href="/team/andrew-vaughn">Andrew</a> so he can correct them. Feel free to also use the source code for the Nielsen Lab website, which can be found at absdjbahjsdbasjhbdhas!!!!!!, for your own site (though we would of course appreciate a citation).
