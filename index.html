		I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu">Computational Biology</a>  
		program at 
		 UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io">Nielsen    
		   Lab</a>. I earned my BA in Mathematics with minors in biology,  
		   computer science, and history from 
		   Cornell in 2019. While at Cornell, I worked in the lab of  
		   <a href="https://messerlab.org/">Philipp Messer</a> on projects on experimental 
		   evolution in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and on the coalescence process 
		   in heterogeneous environments. As a PhD student at Berkeley, my research has 
		   been funded by both the NSF through the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a> 
		   and the NIH through the 
		    <a href="https://ctml.berkeley.edu/biomedical-big-data-training-program-uc-berkeley">Biomedical Big Data Training Program at UC Berkeley</a> program. 
		   My interests lie in admixture graphs, ancestral recombination graphs, ancient DNA,   and 
		   human evolution.
		   You can read more about my research projects  <a href="/research/">here</a> and read my 
		   papers and preprints <a href="/papers/">here</a>.
