Several members of the Nielsen Lab attended the Evolution 2022 conference in Cleveland from June 24-28. It was a week packed with great science (and a bit of baseball too). Thank you to the American Society of Naturalists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, and the Society of Systematic Biologists  for putting this conference together. We're already looking forward to next year!
