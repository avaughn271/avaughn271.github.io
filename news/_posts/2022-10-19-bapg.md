The Nielsen Lab hosted the Fall 2022 Bay Area Population Genomics (BAPG) conference at UC Berkeley. PhD students Yun and Andrew served as organizers and emcees. It was a day full of science and great food. Thank you to everyone who helped make this possible, including our speakers, poster presenters, and our corporate sponsors Ancestry, Variant Bio, D2G Oncology, and Personalis.  (And thank you to Maya and Stacy Li from the Sudmant Lab for the great pictures!)
