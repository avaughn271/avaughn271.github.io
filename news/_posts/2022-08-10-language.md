Lab members Debora Brandt and Emma Steigerwald, with a team of interdisciplinary collaborators, published a piece on how advances in neural machine translation systems can transform the way science is communicated-- from a currently very English-centric hub to a multilingual network-- and why this shift is such an important one to support! They share concrete actions individuals and institutions can take to contribute. You can find the paper "Overcoming Language Barriers in Academia" under the Papers tab.
