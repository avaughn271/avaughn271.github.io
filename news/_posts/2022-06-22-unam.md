As part of the UC MEXUS (University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States) program, lab members Andrew and Diana traveled to the Laboratorio Internacional de Investigaci√≥n sobre el Genoma Humano (LIIGH) at the UNAM campus in Juriquilla, Mexico. It was a great opportunity to chat with collaborators, present on our research projects, and discuss all the great research happening at LIIGH. A big thank you to Diego Ortega del Vecchyo and his lab for hosting us!
