Postdoc Hongru and PhD Students Andrew, Diana, and Yun traveled to Stanford this past weekend to attend the Bay Area Population Genomics (BAPG) conference. It was a great opportunity to hear about all the awesome science going on in the Bay! The Nielsen Lab is looking forward to hosting the next BAPG conference in Berkeley!
