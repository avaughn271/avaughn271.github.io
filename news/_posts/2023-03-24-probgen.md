Postdocs Lenore and Chao and PhD Students Andrew and Yun traveled to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island this past week to attend the Probabilistic Modeling in Genomics conference. We all enjoyed hearing about the great work in statistical genetics and presenting on our own work. Thank you to the organizers for putting on such a great conference!
