It was a summer of travel for many Nielsen Lab members. Andrew, Maya, Fiona, Sasha, and Chao spent a month as guest researchers at the Centre for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, where Rasmus is an affiliate. Andrew and Rasmus also attended a conference on human evolutionary history in Hanover, while Fiona and Maya attended a conference on sedimentary ancient DNA in Potsdam. Some short trips through Sweden and Norway rounded out our tour of Northern Europe. Thank you to the researchers and staff at the Centre for GeoGenetics for hosting us. We hope to be back soon!
