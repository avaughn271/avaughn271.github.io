I'm Jacky, a PhD student in the Biostatistics MA/PhD program. I earned my BS in Statistics in 2023 in China. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in fields such as Quantamental Investing, Federated Learning, and MCMC modeling. However, I eventually discovered my passion for computational and statistical genetics. In the Nielsen Lab, I am currently in the process of learning about evolutionary theory and population genetics while also continuing my work on MCMC modeling. for ancient environment DNA data.
