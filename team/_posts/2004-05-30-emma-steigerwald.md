Climate change represents a serious challenge to biodiversity: species must move, adapt, or die. While species capable of shifting their distributional range are generally viewed as responding successfully to climate change, these range shifts may moderate the ability of species to adapt to concurrent pressures. I am interested in whether climate change can exacerbate emerging infectious disease pressures on wild populations by affecting spatial patterns of genetic diversity.  To explore this question, I work with <i>Pleurodema marmoratum</i> in the Cordillera Vilcanota of Southern Peru-- the highest-living amphibians in the world!
