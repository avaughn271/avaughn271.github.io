I'm a graduate student in Integrative Biology broadly interested in learning about evolution using genomic data. Some of my current projects in the lab are more centered on genomic data analysis and others on the evaluation of population genetics methods using simulations. On the data analysis front, I am studying genomic signatures of demography and natural selection on a South American human population. I am also using simulations to understand the strengths and limitations of methods based on the coalescent with recombination. Before joining the lab, I was trained as a Biologist, with a Bachelor's degree in Biology and a Master's in Genetics at the University of São Paulo (Brazil).
