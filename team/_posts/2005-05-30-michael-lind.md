Michael is a PhD Fellow at Globe, Section for Geogenetics, UCPH and in the context of CCEM he is working on the project “Stochastic Morphometry: Applying stochastic processes to model infinite dimensional shape evolution”. In this project he is going to apply statistical models to test evolutionary hypotheses on empirical shapes ranging from butterfly wing symmetry to the evolutionary change of skulls in wolfs and dogs. Michael finished his MSc “Quantitative Biology and Disease Modelling” from the Technical University of Denmark in summer 2022, and since he saw Mr. DNA Sequence in Jurrassic Park (1993) explaining about how genes control the body had a particular interest in biological systems, evolutionary change and statistics/modelling these.
