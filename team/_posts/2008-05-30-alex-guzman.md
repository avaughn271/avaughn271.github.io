Alex is a PhD student in the Integrative Biology program. He received his BS in Biology (2020) and MS (2022) in Population and Conservation Biology from Texas State University. He is generally interested in evolutionary physiology and population genetics. He is particularly interested in using genomic tools to investigate what and how evolutionary forces and mechanisms are responsible for the maintenance and diversification of species, and speciation. Alex is also interested in trait variation and the bidirectional influence of behavior and hormones in the evolution of novelty. When he's not in the lab, you'll most likely find him somewhere outdoors, hanging out with his cat Coochie or at the bar.
