I obtained my PhD in 2016 in a rice molecular genetics lab, and got interested in the evolutionary genetic aspects of rice. My research interests include understanding mechanisms and consequences of genetic admixture. Currently, I am using rice genus as a model system  to address the potential contribution of gene flow to speciation and domestication. Learning from the genomic pattern of rice domestication, I also work with collaborators to identify and validate new targets for further crop improvement using gene editing technology.
