I’m a grad student in the Computational Biology program. I am interested in using mathematical models to better understand the effects of environmental change on ecological communities. In the Nielsen lab I’m currently working on using data from ancient environmental DNA to understand what factors influenced plant and animal population dynamics in the arctic over the past 50 thousand years.
