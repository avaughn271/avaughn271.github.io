I am a PhD student interested in the mechanisms driving adaptation in natural populations living under extreme conditions. Currently I am at my 4th year of the Doctoral Programme in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution at CIBIO-InBIO & Department of Biology at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto. During these past couple of years I have been working on the genetic basis of desert adaptation.
