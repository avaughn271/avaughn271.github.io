I am a visiting PhD student interested in the mechanisms driving adaptation in natural populations living under extreme conditions. Currently I am in my 4th year of the Doctoral Programme in Biodiversity, Genetics and Evolution at the University of Porto, jointly advised by Rasmus Nielsen at UC Berkeley and Raquel Godinho at CIBIO-InBIO.
