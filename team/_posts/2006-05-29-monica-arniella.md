I am a PhD student in the Computational Biology program. I graduated from Duke University in 2018 with a BS in Biology, then worked in the Getz lab at the Broad Institute studying immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer. I am broadly interested in molecular evolution and statistical phylogenetics. As part of the Nielsen lab, I have been working on improving bioinformatics methods for calling viral genomic sequences using phylogenetic information.
