I am a PhD student in the Computational Biology Program. I am originally from Mexico City. I have a bachelor's degree in Genomic Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. My main projects in the Nielsen lab are about the genetic basis and evolution of color polymorphism. I am particularly working with the toad-headed lizard (<i>Phrynocephalus versicolor</i>) from China and the strawberry poison frog (<i>Oophaga pumilio</i>) from Panama.
